There are two briefing files, both do the same thing.
The one called "briefing.sqf" is the currently enabled brief and is the default blank template.
"enhanced_briefing.sqf" is the same type of file apart from it covers a much in-depth brief with alot of examples on how to write it all up correctly.

To use the enhanced mission briefing please comment out line 52 and uncomment line 53 of preinit.sqf. Then modify the customization\enhanced_briefing.sqf file for your mission.
